    "# Exercise 1: Building Your Own Thematic Map\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Make a map\n",
    "In this exercise, you have the freedom to select your dataset. The main goal is to create a correct and aesthetically pleasing thematic map. Utilize your previous knowledge of cartography, as well as the concepts discussed during the lecture and the discussion session to enhance your map. As the focus is on the map's quality, any suitbale geospatial dataset will suffice. You can find a lot of data sources from the internet. [Paituli](https://paituli.csc.fi/) and [Helsinki InfoShare](https://hri.fi) are great places to start from (examples: accessibility data, population grid, traffic data, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Rememebr to mention the data source and the method you have used for map making (Python (including used libraries), QGIS)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Consider\n",
    "When creating your choropleth map, consider the following aspects:\n",
    "- **Layout**: Organize the spatial elements cohesively and ensure that the layout supports the map's purpose and readability.\n",
    "- **Color Choice**: Select colors that effectively convey information and are accessible.\n",
    "- **Projection**: Choose a suitable projection.\n",
    "- **Map Elements**: Include essential elements.\n",
    "- **Aesthetics**: Use what you learned during this week and do your best to make a nice looking map.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Weekly learning & Cartographic reflection\n",
    "Along with your map, submit a brief reflection (approximately half a page) discussing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- what you learned from this week’s lecture and discussion\n",
    "- Highlight how these insights were incorporated into your map design\n",
    "- Provide a rationale for crucial decisions made during the map-making process, such as choice of projection, color schemes, and inclusion of specific map elements.\n",
    "- Describing what your map reveals and how your cartographic choices influence this interpretation.\n",
    "- Reflect on what you wish to learn from this course to improve this map further. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Working with projections\n",
    "Visit the interactive projection lesson on the course website: [Projections Lesson](https://cartogis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/week1/projections.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the interactive content, you have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **Binder** by clicking the rocket icon at the top left of the lesson page, or open it directly via [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Carto-gis/site/main?urlpath=tree/docs/notebooks/week1/projections.ipynb). Note that launching Binder may take a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternatively, run the `projections.ipynb` notebook in the **CSC Noppe environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Explore the materials and interact with the tools provided. Then answer the following: Which projection introduces the most distortion near the poles, and which one seems to preserve shape better near the equator? Describe your observations using **Tissot’s indicatrix** as a guide.\n",
