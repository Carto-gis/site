    "# Non-Cartographic Representation of Geospatial Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data doesn't always need to be represented on a map. Non-cartographic representations can offer unique insights and allow us to visualize relationships, connections, and patterns that might not be immediately apparent on a traditional map. Here we explore a couple of examples for visualizing geospatial data without maps.\n",

    "**Why Use Non-Cartographic Representations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases non-cartographic visualizations can simplify complex spatial relationships and highlight specific aspects of the data, such as the intensity of interactions between locations or the flow of goods, information, or people. They help in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplifying Complexity**: By abstracting away geographical details, we can focus on the data's relational or structural aspects.\n",
    "- **Emphasizing Connections**: Visualizing the strength and direction of relationships between entities can reveal patterns not visible on a standard map.\n",
    "- **Facilitating Comparisons**: These visualizations can sometimes make it easier to compare spatial relationships across different regions or categories.\n",

    "## Network Graphs for Visualizing Relationships and Adjacency\n",
    "\n",
    "Network graphs are usefool tools for visualizing relationships and adjacency between various entities. They consist of nodes (or vertices) representing entities and edges (or links) denoting relationships or connections between these entities. This visualization technique is particularly useful for illustrating complex networks such as social connections, infrastructure systems, ecological networks, or various kind of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Network graphs are excellent for identifying clusters, central nodes, and the overall structure of the network. They can reveal the most influential entities within a network and how they interact with others.\n",
    "- **Considerations**: With a large number of nodes and edges, network graphs can become overwhelming and difficult to interpret. Strategies such as node aggregation, edge bundling, or interactive filtering may be necessary to maintain clarity.\n",

    "**Example: Visualization neighboring US states**\n",
    "Here we work with a simplified data of US states and their neighbors. We want to create a graph to show their neighboring relationships. For this visualization, we use two prominent Python libraries: Matplotlib and NetworkX.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html) is a comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It provides an extensive array of functions and tools for creating a wide variety of plots and charts, from histograms and scatter plots to complex contour plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[**NetworkX**](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/) is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It provides tools for working with graphs and networks, both simple and complex, with extensive functionality for adding nodes, edges, and applying various algorithms to analyze and visualize network data. We used this in the [AutoGIS course](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/lesson-6/network-analysis.html) to perform a simple network analysis on OSM data and get the shortest route between a pair of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both libraries are open-source and actively maintained, making them relevant in the data science and analytics communities for data visualization and network analysis tasks. They can be used in a wide range of applications, from simple data visualizations to complex analyses of large-scale networks. "
