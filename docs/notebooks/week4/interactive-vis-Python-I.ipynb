    "# Interactive visualizations I\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive maps and visualizations are powerful tools that allow us to understand and interpret complex datasets visually. They enable users to explore and interact with data in a more intuitive and insightful way, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers that might not be immediately apparent in raw datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive maps and visualizations are essential tools in a cartographer's toolkit, providing a bridge between complex datasets and users. By using the many available Python libraries for interactive visualization, we can create compelling, interactive visual narratives that communicate their findings effectively and engage their audience. This is an essential skill for a cartographer creating maps for the web or for various interactive platforms and devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Interactive Maps and Visualizations?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Engagement**: Interactive elements encourage users to explore data further, fostering a deeper understanding and engagement with the content.\n",
    "- **Improved Accessibility**: They make complex data more accessible to a broader audience by translating numbers and figures into visual formats.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Exploration**: Users can filter, zoom, and manipulate the data dynamically, allowing for personalized data exploration experiences.\n",
    "- **Real-time Data Representation**: Interactive visualizations can be updated in real-time, providing the most current insights into evolving datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactive maps and temporal data\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive maps are also useful for presenting temporal data. When datasets contain time-related attributes—such as dates or timestamps—interactive maps can bring this dimension to life. They enable users to observe how spatial patterns evolve over time, offering insights into trends, seasonal variations, and temporal anomalies within the geographical context. Here are a few examples of how the temporal dimension can be used in an interactive visualization: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Animation Over Time**: Interactive maps can incorporate time as an animation axis, allowing viewers to play through changes in the data over days, months, years, or any relevant time period. This dynamic representation makes it easier to understand the progression and regression of phenomena, such as the spread of wildfires, changes in air quality, or urban development patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time-based Filtering**: They provide mechanisms to filter data by specific time frames, such as sliders or date pickers, enabling users to focus on particular periods of interest and observe how spatial distributions align with historical events or policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layering Temporal Data**: Interactive maps can layer data from different time periods, allowing for direct comparison and deeper analysis of how areas have changed over time. This can be crucial for understanding long-term environmental changes, demographic shifts, or the impact of infrastructure projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries for Creating Interactive Maps and Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Several libraries are available for creating interactive maps and visualizations, each with its unique features and capabilities. Here are a few commonly used libraries which we also use today in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Plotly**](https://plotly.com/python/): Plotly is an advanced visualization library that supports a wide range of interactive chart types, such as scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, box plots, histograms, 3D charts, and geographical maps, among others. Plotly excels in creating interactive and web-ready plots that can be easily embedded in web applications or Jupyter notebooks. It offers a high level of interactivity, including zooming, panning, and updating data in real-time. Plotly's API is well-designed, making it accessible to beginners while powerful enough to meet the needs of advanced users for custom and dynamic visualizations. Additionally, Plotly can be used in combination with Dash, a framework for building analytical web applications, to create highly interactive, data-driven applications.\n",
    "2. [**Folium**](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/): Folium is a powerful Python library that helps bridge the gap between Python and the Leaflet.js library to create interactive and attractive maps. It allows data scientists and developers to visualize geospatial data generated in Python using the intuitive capabilities of Leaflet.js. Folium supports various map styles, overlays, and features, including markers, polygons, popups, and more, enabling users to build sophisticated map-based visualizations directly from their Python environment. The library integrates seamlessly with pandas for data manipulation, making it an excellent tool for spatial data analysis and visualization. This library is more extensively described on [AutoGIS course pages](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/lesson-5/interactive-maps.html)."

To maintain consistent visibility of all regions, regardless of incident occurrence, we could refine our dataset to include entries with zero incidents for such periods. Alternatively, I'll re-introduce the polygon layer as an overlay or trace layer. This ensures the boundaries of Finland's regions remain visible at all times, providing a continuous geographical context."
