    "# A Local Static Map - Visualizing PPGIS Data from Helsinki: the QGIS approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will work with a PPGIS dataset from Helsinki and explore methods to create a local map of our data. Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) blend GIS technologies with public participation processes for a more inclusive approach to spatial planning and policymaking. PPGIS utilizes map-based surveys and geospatial tools to gather public feedback on projects like urban development, environmental conservation, and transportation planning. Its key focus is enabling communities to contribute directly to the planning process, ensuring decisions are democratic, equitable, and informed. Learn more about PPGIS [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_GIS).\n",
