    "# Exercise 2: Static Local/Global map\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you can choose from two data options to create a static local or global map, as praticed during the tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose another PPGIS dataset from [this repository](https://zenodo.org/communities/softgis-aalto/records?q=&f=resource_type%3Adataset&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest) and explore it using appropriate visulization methods.\n",
    "- Use the global [powerplants](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase) data and make a global map. Use the appropriate visulization method for your map to explore interesting aspects of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main point of this exercise is to make a correct and beautiful map so you do not necessaarily need to do a lot of analyis on the data. Use what you have learned during the lecture and discussion session and implement the ideas in your map. \n",
    "\n",
    "When making the map, keep the following points in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good chocie of colors\n",
    "- Visual hierarchy\n",
    "- Use of suitable projection\n",
    "- Use of map elements which are necessary for the map\n",
    "- Map layout\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to return?\n",
    "In addition to your map, include a short (half a page) reflection of what you learned from this week's lecture and discussion and how these were taken into consideration in your map. Include a short justification of the important decisons you make in your map making (such as projection, color choices, inclusion of elements, etc). Briefly describe what your map reveals and how your cartographic choices have aggected that. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Rememebr to mention the method you have used for map making (Python (including used libraries), or QGIS)*. "
